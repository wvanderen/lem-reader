# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-26)

**Core value:** Readers can move through long-form web content with calm, stable orientation and predictable navigation.
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — accessible-scrolling-reader

## Current Position

Phase: 02 (accessible-scrolling-reader) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 3
Status: Ready to execute

Progress: [██████████] 100% (Phase 01)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 14 min
- Total execution time: 0.2 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

- [Roadmap]: Use one canonical document coordinate system before any durable location, pagination, or annotation behavior.
- [Roadmap]: Keep semantic scrolling continuously viable before and during pagination work.
- [Roadmap]: Require calibrated browser measurement before enabling any Pretext fast path.
- [Phase ?]: D-04 inline marks locked to 4 (link/code/strong/em); D-05 grapheme coordinates over normalized text; D-06 slug id + monotonic revision
- [Phase ?]: Recursive Block type uses two-pass Zod declaration (hand-written union + z.ZodType annotation — Pitfall 7)
- [Phase ?]: Rule 3 deviation: @typescript-eslint hard-throws on TS 7.0; eslint.config.js uses @babel/eslint-parser instead, all security rules (react/no-danger etc.) preserved and verified firing
- [Phase ?]: [Phase 01-02]: One h1 per page — ArticleView renders title from provenance; article bodies start at h2 (a11y)
- [Phase ?]: [Phase 01-02]: Hash-based routing confirmed (A2) — window.location.hash + hashchange, no router library
- [Phase 01]: [Phase 01-04]: Inset unification lives on main#main (not per-view wrappers) — closes fixture-list flush-edge gap with one rule, no double inset
- [Phase 01]: [Phase 01-04]: Error heading level split by page context — ArticleView uses <h1> (standalone error page), FixtureList uses <h2> (page already has <h1>Saved articles</h1>); preserves one-h1-per-page
- [Phase ?]: [Phase 01-05]: Route/fragment distinction lives in the hashchange handler (not parseHash) — parseHash must still map bad #/ deep links to the list; the guard prevents fragment-only hashes from reaching setView so native scroll targets stay mounted
- [Phase ?]: [Phase 01-05]: Footnote back-link visible glyph is U+21A9 as a React text child + aria-label 'Return to reference N'; fn.id schema-locked to digits-only so suffix is injection-safe; no new CSS (app.css owned by sibling 01-04)
- [Phase ?]: Phase 02-01: Native <dialog>/showModal chosen for settings panel; manual triggerRef.current?.focus() restore in close listener (Pitfall 1) — Free focus trap/Esc/inert/backdrop; canonical per 02-RESEARCH anti-pattern #1
- [Phase ?]: Phase 02-01: applyTheme writes data-theme + 6 CSS custom properties on documentElement (D2-03 live-apply) — Single token swap honors authored-CSS/no-Tailwind constraint; values derive from Zod-validated enums/numbers (no XSS surface, T-02-02)
- [Phase ?]: Phase 02-01: Dexie version(2) re-declares same stores — schema no-op in Dexie >=3; anchors STATE-04 migration hook (Pitfall 9 honored) — v1 wrote zero records; no data migration needed; gives Plan 02 clean place to evolve
- [Phase ?]: Phase 02-01: Explicit focus on first control after showModal + removed <form method=dialog> wrapper — WebKit does not auto-focus modal-dialog controls; form wrapper interfered with Chromium focus-trap wrap-around (focus escaped to body)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 3]: Pretext adoption tolerances, metric fingerprints, image readiness, and performance profiles require empirical planning.
- [Phase 4]: Rich-content fragmentation and oversize policies require corpus-driven rules.
- [Phase 5]: Offset units, grapheme handling, overlap semantics, and anchor confidence thresholds need explicit decisions.
- [Phase 6]: Concrete browser/OS/screen-reader support combinations and manual protocol remain to be selected.
