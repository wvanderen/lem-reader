# Phase 13: Polish and Acceptance — ACPT-05 Acceptance Record

<!--
  GSD-managed evidence document (Plan 13-05 Task 1). The ACPT-05 acceptance
  instrument: the user-runnable NVDA+Firefox runbook + findings record sheet,
  plus the supplementary VoiceOver+Safari checklist for the NEW v2.0 surfaces.
  The instrument executed is docs/ACCEPTANCE-PROTOCOL.md v1.0 — it is
  referenced AS-DOCUMENTED and stays byte-unchanged (D13-04). This ledger
  copies the Phase 6 acceptance-ledger shape
  (.planning/milestones/v1.0-phases/06-prototype-acceptance/06-VERIFICATION.md)
  and closes the A4 coverage boundary that ledger recorded: the NVDA+Firefox
  pairing that was not run in v1.0.

  D13-07 (prepare-then-run-later): this file ships the runbook + EMPTY record
  sheets now. The user runs the protocol on Windows hardware on their own
  schedule. ACPT-05 flips from Pending only when the results land here.
-->

**Phase:** 13 — Polish and Acceptance
**Instrument:** `docs/ACCEPTANCE-PROTOCOL.md` v1.0 (unmodified — D13-04)
**Prepared:** 2026-08-19 (Plan 13-05 Task 1)
**Ledger status:** Pending user run (see §2 — the flip condition)

## 1. ACPT-05 — NVDA+Firefox acceptance run

> **Requirement:** ACPT-05 — Reader can complete the documented screen-reader
> acceptance flows on NVDA+Firefox, closing the v1.0 ACPT-02 reduced-gate
> coverage boundary (A4).

### 1.1 Environment prerequisites

| Item | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| Screen reader | **NVDA** — current stable release |
| Browser | **Firefox** — current stable release |
| Hardware/OS | **Windows** (native hardware or a setup the tester considers representative of their reading environment) |
| App | Lem Reader dev server: `npm run dev` → http://localhost:5173 |
| Clean state | Follow the protocol's Setup (§3): wipe local data before the run (settings → "Clear local data", or clear the `lem-reader` IndexedDB), then reload |

Record the actual environment when the run happens:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Run date(s) | _____________ |
| Tester | _____________ |
| NVDA version | _____________ |
| Firefox version | _____________ |
| Windows version | _____________ |

### 1.2 Run instructions — the protocol AS-DOCUMENTED (D13-04)

Run `docs/ACCEPTANCE-PROTOCOL.md` **v1.0 exactly as documented** — no v2.0
addendum (a v2.0-surface extension is a recorded deferred idea, not part of
this run):

1. Execute the **six v1.0 scripted flows (§3)** in order, A through F:
   Flow A — Open article and read end-to-end · Flow B — Switch reading mode
   (M) · Flow C — Create a highlight · Flow D — View, edit, and delete a
   highlight + note (drawer) · Flow E — Navigate from a saved annotation back
   to its passage · Flow F — Adjust settings.
2. Execute the **five exploratory charters (§4)** in order, 1 through 5:
   Charter 1 — Full reading + annotation loop, SR-only · Charter 2 — Every
   fixture, end-to-end, both modes · Charter 3 — Fallback orientation ·
   Charter 4 — Edge conditions under SR · Charter 5 — Discoverability without
   prior knowledge.
3. Record each step's outcome using the protocol's **Pitfall 7 discipline
   (§2)**: verify and record **role + accessible name + state** — the
   programmatically stable properties — and **never verbatim screen-reader
   phrasing**. Phrasing observations (what the synthesizer happened to say)
   are informational only: record them as **minor** findings in the findings
   table, never as pass/fail criteria.
4. Classify every finding with the **severity rubric (§5, D6-07)**: blocker /
   major / minor. **Pass = zero blocker AND zero major.** An announcement that
   is confusing but where the step still completes correctly is **minor**
   unless content or a required function is lost or unreachable (then major
   or blocker).

### 1.3 Findings record sheet (empty — fill as the run proceeds)

Same shape as the Phase 6 ledger. One row per finding; append rows as needed.

| Finding id | Flow / charter | Severity (blocker\|major\|minor) | Observed outcome (role + accessible name + state) | Expected outcome (role + accessible name + state) | Status (open\|fixed\|deferred) |
|------------|----------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| — | — | — | — | — | — |

_(no findings recorded yet — the run has not happened)_

### 1.4 Per-flow / per-charter pass checklist (six flows + five charters)

Record PASS or the highest finding severity observed in that flow/charter
(§5 rubric), plus a note if useful.

| # | Flow / charter | Result (☐ PASS / severity) | Notes |
|---|----------------|----------------------------|-------|
| A | Open article and read end-to-end | ☐ | |
| B | Switch reading mode (M) | ☐ | |
| C | Create a highlight | ☐ | |
| D | View, edit, delete a highlight + note (drawer) | ☐ | |
| E | Navigate from a saved annotation back to its passage | ☐ | |
| F | Adjust settings (typography / theme / measure) | ☐ | |
| 1 | Charter — Full reading + annotation loop, SR-only | ☐ | |
| 2 | Charter — Every fixture, end-to-end, both modes | ☐ | |
| 3 | Charter — Fallback orientation | ☐ | |
| 4 | Charter — Edge conditions under SR | ☐ | |
| 5 | Charter — Discoverability without prior knowledge | ☐ | |

**Run verdict (fill at completion):** _____________
_(PASS = zero blocker and zero major across all eleven rows)_

---

## 2. D13-07 status note — when ACPT-05 flips

**ACPT-05 remains Pending.** This plan (13-05) ships the instrument only —
the runbook and empty record sheets above. Per D13-07
(instrument-ships-now / requirement-closes-at-proof, the 04-02 and 06-04
precedent):

- ACPT-05 flips from Pending to complete **only when the user-run results
  land in this file** (§1.3 findings + §1.4 checklist + verdict filled in)
  with **zero blocker and zero major findings** (D6-07 pass policy).
- **Blocker/major findings do not fail the requirement outright** — they
  follow the **fix-then-re-run policy (D13-06, the 06-06 precedent)**: the
  finding is fixed in-phase, and the affected flow(s) are re-run until zero
  blocker/major remains. The flip happens at that point.
- **Minor findings are recorded and deferred** — they never block the flip.
- Until then, the `ACPT-05` checkbox in `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` stays
  **unchecked**.

## 3. Supplementary — VoiceOver+Safari re-run (v2.0 surfaces)

> **This is supplementary evidence, explicitly NOT an ACPT-05 gate (D13-05).**
> It honors the protocol's own re-run rule (§7: re-run on any material change
> to the reader surface — Phases 7–12 added five phases' worth of new
> surfaces) without extending the v1.0 protocol document itself. It runs on
> the user's macOS hardware when ready, on the user's own schedule, and its
> findings follow the same severity rubric (§5) and fix-then-re-run policy
> (D13-06). A blocker/major here is recorded and fixed like any other
> finding, but it does not gate ACPT-05.

### 3.1 Scope — the NEW v2.0 surfaces only

The v1.0 flows (§3 of the protocol) were already executed under
VoiceOver+Safari in Phase 6 (see the 06-VERIFICATION ledger). This re-run
covers only surfaces that did not exist then. Same outcome discipline applies
(Pitfall 7: role + accessible name + state, never verbatim SR phrasing).

| # | v2.0 surface group | What to exercise (goal-oriented) | Result (☐ PASS / severity) | Notes |
|---|--------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|-------|
| V1 | **Library browse / search / tag filter** | Browse the saved-articles list; use the library search; filter by tag; open an article from a row; confirm row information (title, source, progress) is announced and reachable | ☐ | |
| V2 | **Ingest form — including calm refusal outcomes** | Add content through the ingest form (e.g. a `.md` file); then trigger at least one calm refusal (e.g. a corrupt or over-cap PDF) and confirm the refusal lands as calm, jargon-free copy in the status region — never an error dump | ☐ | |
| V3 | **Review panel — jump / curate** | Open the review panel; jump from a review row back to its highlighted passage; curate (edit a review note, delete a highlight via its confirm dialog) | ☐ | |
| V4 | **Export / import dialogs** | Build and download an export bundle from settings; import a bundle through the preview dialog (proceed, and one skip/conflict path); confirm dialog focus behavior and announced outcomes | ☐ | |
| V5 | **Book groupings — expand/collapse + chapter navigation** | Expand a book grouping in the library; open its chapter list; open a chapter; navigate between chapter chrome and back to the library | ☐ | |

### 3.2 VO findings record sheet (empty — fill as the run proceeds)

Same shape as §1.3.

| Finding id | Surface group | Severity (blocker\|major\|minor) | Observed outcome (role + accessible name + state) | Expected outcome (role + accessible name + state) | Status (open\|fixed\|deferred) |
|------------|---------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| — | — | — | — | — | — |
